{"id":"speechall-typescript-sdk-yp5","title":"Fix OpenAPI spec: rename 'timestamp_granularities[]' to 'timestamp_granularities'","description":"The OpenAPI specification file has a field named 'timestamp_granularities[]' which includes brackets in the field name. This causes issues with code generation as the brackets are interpreted as array notation rather than part of the property name.\n\n## Problem\n\nIn the OpenAPI spec at '../speechall-openapi/openapi.yaml', the field is defined as:\n```yaml\ntimestamp_granularities[]:\n  description: \u003e\n    The timestamp granularities to populate...\n  type: array\n  items:\n    type: string\n```\n\nThis generates TypeScript code like:\n```typescript\nif (request.timestamp_granularities[] != null) {  // Syntax error!\n```\n\n## Solution\n\nRename the field in the OpenAPI spec from `timestamp_granularities[]` to `timestamp_granularities` (without brackets). The array type should be specified only in the `type: array` declaration, not in the field name.\n\n## Workaround Applied\n\nThe generated TypeScript SDK code has been manually fixed to use bracket notation:\n```typescript\nif (request[\"timestamp_granularities[]\"] != null) {\n```\n\nHowever, this is a temporary fix. The OpenAPI spec should be corrected at the source.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-16T14:34:18.63905+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T14:34:36.771198+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"speechall-typescript-sdk-yp5","depends_on_id":"speechall-typescript-sdk-vi2.5","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-12-16T14:34:18.642346+01:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
